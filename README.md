# Rearrengine

This engine is been developed with the objective of learning game development. The main functionality of the engine so far is to render 3D models with a diffuse texture. Implementing a basic graphic user interface is crucial for facilitating the user all the information related to the model that's been rendered.

- Up, Down, Left & Right to rotate the camera in that direction.

Dragging and dropping textures: apply the new texture to the existing model.
